# React Challenge


## How to deploy
 - Create a .env file in the root directory on the application.
 - Paste the following snippet:
  ```code
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_APIKEY=AIzaSyDzehZryzqHYGsAnvRq3sVB7MCxNsoig5g
    REACT_APP_VISUAL_CROSSING_APIKEY=G7NLAZAG8EAM28XJ4YTJ64TLM
  ```
 - Run `npm install` | `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
 - Run `npm start`   | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
 - You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.



## Some features i would like to implement at a later date:
  1. Responsiveness (as of now, the app only looks good on a Desktop screen, and I couldn't implement a reponsive layout in time)
  2. Data persistence on localStorage
  3. Integration with Google Calendar, to persist and display reminders to and from the google account
